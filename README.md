Learning bash...one carrot at a time

Hi! do99o here, this is my official first github repository! Yay me! This repository is for learning bash...one carrot at a time. I am new to bash and I have a hard time looking for sources which give you ALL the information... This repository will help you find ALL the info in ONE place...now that sounds great. These files will show you how to go from basics to advanced bash programming and I think this will be very useful. The contents of this repository are different examples that can be used to learn bash. Every folder will contain 3 files: 1 Instructions file, 1 completed script, and 1 blank file (non-executable yet). Scripts will be refered as "carrots" (all carrots are going to be..*drumroll*..carrot themed!).

NOTE: PLEASE DON'T USE THIS AS YOUR ONLY RESOURCE...THERE ARE MANY ARTICLES AND EXAMPLES ON THE INTERNET

This is a work in progress. THIS IS NOT BY ANY MEANS FINISHED

If there are any issues or anything that bothers you about the carrots don't hesitate to post an issue!
